    <p>Hey Jesinth,</p>

    <p>I know Valentine’s Day is not a very big thing for us, but this year I just wanted to make it a little special. So this is for you.</p>

    <p>We do not need one special day to show our love. But today I just want to say something from my heart.</p>

    <p>No matter what happens in life, I will always be by your side. In happy times and in hard times, I will stand with you. I choose you and I choose us.</p>

    <p>The only thing I ask from you is loyalty. That is what matters the most to me. If we are honest and loyal to each other, I believe we can face anything together.</p>

    <p>I want us to grow together. I want us to work on our careers, achieve our goals, and slowly build the future we dream about. One day I hope we can live our dream life together.</p>

    <p>I really love you so much. Thank you for being in my life.</p>

    <p>Happy Valentine’s Day, my love. ❤️</p>
